# EE-Calculator
Calculator for simple electrical engineering projects written in Python

Currently this program can be used to calculate values from Ohm's law if 2 of the following values are entered:
* Voltage (V or mV)
* Current (A or mA)
* Resistance (Ohm or kOhm)

Power (Watts) is calculated at the finish as well
