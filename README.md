## EE-Calculator

*Calculator for simple electrical engineering projects that is written in Python*

####Calculation of Ohm's Law:
* Voltage (V or mV)
* Current (A or mA)
* Resistance (Ohm or kOhm)

Power (Watts) is calculated at the finish as well

####Calculation of 4-band resistor codes:

Values can be entered for the colors of each band and the resistance will be given in Omhs (Î© ) and the tolerance (%)
